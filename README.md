# Gray-scale digit recognition
Implement feed-forward propagation and back propagation from scratch to train a 3 layer neural network to recognize 
handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer). Also implement a CNN model using 
Keras framework to perform the same task. \
The traditional model performs with 95% accuracy on the test set, while the CNN model performs with 99.6% accuracy.
